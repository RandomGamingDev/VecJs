# VecJs
A basic javascript library for dynamic vectors (e.g. vec2 &amp; vec3) based on lists.

To use the library simply create a new instance of the Vec class which you can create by specifying a specific size to instantiate a `Vec` instance with `new Vec(2)`, of a certain number repeating with `Vec.mono(3, 2)`, or from a list with `Vec.fromArr([123, 321])`. Other than that there are a multitude of functions for dealing with operations like, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, whether with a single number or with another vector, and for the copying and slicing of these vectors.

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/VecJs/vec.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
